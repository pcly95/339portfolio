      <h1 class="alternate-h1">Hi! I’m Patrick, a visual and interaction designer based in Vancouver, Canada.</h1>
      <p class="about-paragraph">I’ve had an obsession of expressing myself through drawing and making intricate crafts ever since a young age. Growing older, I've learned to transfer my skills into digital media and eventually became exposed to user experience design. I continue to work and practice UX using tools such as Illustrator, Sketch, Flinto, InVision, HTML5, and CSS3 as well as processes in user research, developing user journey frameworks, and creating personas.</p>
