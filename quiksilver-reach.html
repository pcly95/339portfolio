      <h2>design process</h2>

      <h3>identifying the business problem</h3>
      <p>As we were looking for potential mock clients to work with, we encounter several possible clients with business problems: Barnes and Noble, Sony, and Quiksilver. We decided on choosing Quiksilver because we found that there was sufficient potential to propose a solution for their business problem. After conducting in-depth research on Quiksilver’s brand and values, we understood the scope of our project.</p>

      <h3>our intervention</h3>
      <p>As a team we diverged our ideas by asking ourselves how we might tackle the business problem. We went through several iterations and changes before we got to our main question to frame the product: <em>how can Quiksilver use technology to support athletes in achieving their goals by measuring their progress?</em></p>

      <h3>persona</h3>
      <p>We developed our persona based on research done online about young surfers and their journey on developing as a professional surfer. Due to the short timeframe of the project, we couldn’t conduct in-person interviews with real young surfers. Having in-person interviews would have definitely gave us improved insights for our project.</p>

      <h3>customer journey framework</h3>
      <p>The journey framework was developed and iterated based on an existing surf performance application we chose to work and improve on. We redefined the use of the application by integrating a “before surf” experience and by refining the “after surf” experience.</p>

      <h2>reflection</h2>
      <p>Overall, we were satisfied as to how far we went with our project. As this was one of the first user experience courses I’ve taken, it was an intense experience to be thrown in the deep end. This project helped me realise the importance in communicating an idea and executing it at a high level.</p>
