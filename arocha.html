      <h2>research + process methods</h2>
      <p>The focus for this project was to experiment with various research methods to understand our participant group at a human-experience level: their motivations, struggles, values, and aspirations. Below are several select methods we found to be most useful to relate to their needs.</p>

      <h3>ethnography study + interviews</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the ethnography study was to get a better understanding of the company’s ethos. We conducted 4 in-person interviews with various expertises to learn how each group comes together to work as a whole.</p>

      <h3>persona:</h3>
      <p>The personas were built off of the people we interviewed. It served as a useful tool that helped guide the rest of our design process.</p>

      <h3>participatory workshop</h3>
      <p>The participatory workshop was where we got a better understanding of the internal processes of the company. We were able to map out the current experience of their processes and see where we alleviate existing pain points.</p>

      <h3>customer journey framework</h3>
      <p>The journey framework was developed based on our understanding of the persona and their current internal processes. We mapped out the ideal experience for a volunteer who is interested in joining opportunities at A Rocha.</p>

      <h3>information architecture</h3>
      <p>Given the short span of 1 week to execute the prototype, I quickly mapped out the general information architecture of the web application in order to move into the execution phase. This map acted as the foundation for the prototype.</p>

      <h2>reflection</h2>
      <p>This project helped me realise the value in working directly with your target audience. Being able to gain direct feedback and suggestions and understanding the company as a whole gave me a newfound appreciation for user research.</p>
